# Particle system demo

This is an implementation of a simple 3D particle system and its visualization.

The demo is available at https://matejbevec.github.io/msc-advanced-graphics/as3/.

Currently supports:
* point emitters
* disk emitters
* planar colliders

As well as the following force objects:
* constant force
* gravity
* drag
* radial force

In terms of solvers, both `Euler's method` and `4th order Runge-Kutta` are included.
